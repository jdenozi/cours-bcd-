abstract = {NFECTIOUS agents can induce autoimmune diseases in several experimental settings, some of which have clinical counterparts. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain these ob-servations, including molecular mimicry and an in-crease in the immunogenicity of autoantigens caused by inflammation in the target organ. 1 Paradoxically, in-fectious agents can also suppress allergic and autoim-mune disorders. In this review, I will summarize the evidence that the main factor in the increased preva-lence of these diseases in industrialized countries is the reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases in those countries over the past three decades. This concept is not new. In 1966, for example, Leibowitz et al. suggested that the risk of multiple sclerosis is in-creased among persons who spent their childhood in a home with a high level of sanitation. 2 About 20 years later, Strachan observed that the risk of allergic rhini-tis was inversely linked to birth order and the size of the family. He proposed that infections within house-holds in early childhood have a role in preventing al-lergic rhinitis. 3 Since then, numerous epidemiologic and experimental studies have sought to clarify and extend this so-called hygiene hypothesis concerning asthma and other allergic diseases and autoimmune disorders. CONTRASTING EPIDEMIOLOGIC TRENDS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES Epidemiologic data provide strong evidence of a steady rise in the incidence of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed countries over the past three dec-ades. The incidence of many diseases of these two gen-eral types has increased: asthma, 4 rhinitis, 5 and atopic dermatitis, 6 representing allergic diseases, and multi-I},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by multiple demyelinating lesions disseminated in the central nervous system. The clinical course of MS involves acute attacks leading to permanent disability and a chronic progressive stage occurring at the beginning of the disease or after a relapsing-remitting phase. Investigations that provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis of MS are magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Recent pathological studies showed evidence of early axonal pathology, remyelination in some cases, and diffuse pathology. Genetic and immunological studies suggest that MS is an auto-immune disease, partially genetically determined but the role of an environmental factor, possibly infectious is possible. Cumulative evidence of the efficacy of interferon beta and other disease-modifying drug therapy has completely modified the therapeutic approach of MS. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier SAS.
